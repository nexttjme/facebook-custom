# Facebook Fullscreen Tapermonkey/Stylish Chrome Theme
It's a custom theme for Facebook that's fullscreen.  I was sick and tired of normal Facebook, so I created my own.

## Features
* Configurable, comprehensive ``variables.less`` file.  Change Facebook's look in seconds only by adjusting any of the
colours
* Generated, automated grid system, just like Bootstrap, but fluid, for real; no ``px``, just percentages.
* Comes with and uses a customizable, generable form of Andy Taylor's 1140 grid system.  Optimized media queries,
with nothing in them, so you can just dive right in.  I use Javascript to adapt Facebook to this grid system.
